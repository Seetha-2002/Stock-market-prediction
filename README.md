- `README.md`: This file.
## Features
- Modular and object-oriented design
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Model saving and loading capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation
# Requrements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
# Installation
1. clone the Repository
   - git clone [https://github.com/Seetha-2002/stock-market-prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction](https://github.com/Seetha-2002/Stock-market-prediction)
2. Install dependencies
   - pip install -r [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
# Usage
1. Place your stock market data in CSV format in the dataloader.py directory
2. Run the prediction model:
   -[main.py](main.py)
# Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:

- Input layer with 60 time steps
- First LSTM layer with 50 units and return sequences
- Dropout layer (20%)
- Second LSTM layer with 50 units
- Dropout layer (20%)
- Dense output layer
# Data Preprocessing

- Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler
- Sequences of 60 time steps are used for prediction
- Data is split into training and testing sets (80/20)

# Results
The model's performance can be evaluated using:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values
